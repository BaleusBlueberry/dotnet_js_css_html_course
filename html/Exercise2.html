    <h1>Exercise 1</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Writing always begins with white space — a blank page or word document.
        I like to think of it as a place — a silent world where stories, ideas
        and characters live until they are pulled into existence by our words,
        sentences and stanzas. A place that remains even after we cleave that
        blank page with lines of poetry.
      </p>
